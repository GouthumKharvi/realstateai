This project is an AI-enabled Procurement and Contract Lifecycle System designed for the Contracts &amp; Purchase team in Real Estate. The goal is to reduce manual effort, improve decision quality, and ensure compliance across the entire procurement lifecycle using a single reusable AI architecture.

## Mock Data Strategy

- All demos use **synthetic mock datasets**
- Data is generated programmatically
- Same structure as real ERP / DMS data
- Easy migration to production systems later

---

## What Is Implemented vs Planned

### Implemented (Prototype Level)
- Generic architecture
- RAG vector database
- OCR pipeline
- Rule engine
- ML stubs
- Multiple stages wired to same pipeline

### Planned (Next Phase)
- ERP integration
- Real-time workflows
- Approval automation
- Model retraining pipelines
- Access control and audit logs

---

## Key Design Philosophy

- Human-in-the-loop
- Explainable AI
- Minimal code
- Maximum reuse
- Business-first AI

---

## Summary

This project demonstrates how **one well-designed AI architecture** can power an entire procurement and contract lifecycle with:
- Transparency
- Scalability
- Governance
- Real-world practicality

It is designed to **work today with mock data** and **scale tomorrow into production**.
