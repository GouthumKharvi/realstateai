================================================================================

Notes:
1. These liability & indemnity clauses are generic GCC templates and must be
   aligned with Special Conditions of Contract (SCC), project risk profile,
   and applicable law.
2. Parties should clearly specify caps, exclusions, IP allocation, and HSE
   responsibilities in SCC and Contract Data.
3. Legal advice is recommended when adapting these clauses for high-value or
   complex projects.
