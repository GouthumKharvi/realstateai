                        GENERAL CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT (GCC)
                            PENALTY & LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CLAUSES
================================================================================

Document Reference: GCC-PEN-2026-v3.2
Last Updated: January 1, 2026
Applicable to: All Construction, Infrastructure & Engineering Projects
Jurisdiction: India (Subject to Indian Contract Act, 1872 - Section 74)
Legal Framework: Section 73, 74 of Indian Contract Act, 1872


PREAMBLE: LEGAL BASIS AND DEFINITIONS
================================================================================

SECTION 74, INDIAN CONTRACT ACT, 1872:
"When a contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount
to be paid in case of such breach, or if the contract contains any other stipulation
by way of penalty, the party complaining of the breach is entitled, whether or not
actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby, to receive from the
party who has broken the contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount
so named or, as the case may be, the penalty stipulated for."

KEY LEGAL PRINCIPLE:
Courts in India do not enforce "penalty" as punishment but award "reasonable
compensation" for actual or estimated loss suffered due to breach of contract.
The burden of proof for actual loss lies with the claimant, but courts may
award compensation even without strict proof if damages are genuine pre-estimate.


SECTION 1: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS
================================================================================

1.1 DISTINCTION BETWEEN PENALTY AND LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

    A. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES (LD):
       - Pre-estimated genuine calculation of probable loss due to breach
       - Represents actual anticipated damage to Employer/Client
       - Based on reasonable commercial assessment at time of contract
       - Generally enforceable under Indian law if reasonable
       - Focus: Compensation for genuine loss

       Example: Rs. 50,000 per day delay for hotel construction where hotel
       operator estimates daily room revenue loss of Rs. 45,000-55,000

    B. PENALTY:
       - Arbitrary amount intended to punish or deter breach
       - Disproportionate to actual anticipated loss
       - Not based on genuine pre-estimate of damage
       - Courts reduce penalty to reasonable compensation
       - Focus: Punishment and deterrence

       Example: Rs. 10,00,000 per day penalty for minor landscaping delay
       where actual loss is minimal - Court will reduce to reasonable amount

1.2 ENFORCABILITY IN INDIA

    Indian Position (Different from Common Law):
    - Section 74 allows recovery without proof of actual loss
    - But amount must be "reasonable compensation"
    - Courts have power to reduce excessive amounts
    - Burden on claimant to show amount is reasonable pre-estimate
    - Leading Case: ONGC vs Saw Pipes (2003) - Liquidated damages enforceable
                    if genuine pre-estimate, even without proving actual loss

1.3 REASONABLE COMPENSATION TEST

    Courts consider following factors:
    a) Nature and type of contract
    b) Commercial realities and market conditions
    c) Industry standards and benchmarks
    d) Relationship between stipulated amount and probable loss
    e) Whether parties dealt at arm's length
    f) Bargaining power of parties
    g) Actual loss suffered (if provable)


SECTION 2: LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DELAY IN COMPLETION
================================================================================

2.1 DELAY LIQUIDATED DAMAGES (DLD) - TIME-BASED

    A. STANDARD CLAUSE:

    "If the Contractor fails to achieve Completion by the Time for Completion,
    the Contractor shall pay Delay Liquidated Damages to the Employer for this
    default at the rate stated in the Contract Data.

    These Delay Liquidated Damages shall be the only damages due to the Employer
    for such default, other than in the event of termination under the Contract.

    The total amount of Delay Liquidated Damages shall not exceed the maximum
    amount stated in the Contract Data."

    B. TYPICAL RATES (Indian Construction Industry):

    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Project Type           │ LD Rate (per week) │ Maximum Cap            │
    ├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ Building Construction  │ 0.5% to 1.0%       │ 10% of Contract Value │
    │ Roads & Highways       │ 0.25% to 0.5%      │ 5% to 10%             │
    │ Power Projects         │ 1.0% to 2.0%       │ 15% to 20%            │
    │ Oil & Gas             │ 0.5% to 1.5%       │ 10% to 15%            │
    │ IT/Software Projects   │ 1.0% to 3.0%       │ 15% to 25%            │
    │ MEP Installation      │ 0.75% to 1.5%      │ 10% to 12%            │
    │ Manufacturing Plant   │ 1.5% to 2.5%       │ 20% to 25%            │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    Note: Percentages calculated on Total Contract Value

    C. CALCULATION METHOD:

    Example 1: Building Construction Project
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Contract Value:                Rs. 10,00,00,000
    LD Rate:                       0.5% per week of delay
    Maximum LD Cap:                10% of contract value = Rs. 1,00,00,000
    Actual Delay:                  30 weeks

    LD Calculation:
    - Weekly LD = 0.5% x Rs. 10,00,00,000 = Rs. 5,00,000
    - Total LD for 30 weeks = Rs. 5,00,000 x 30 = Rs. 1,50,00,000
    - But maximum cap is Rs. 1,00,00,000
    - Therefore, LD Payable = Rs. 1,00,00,000 (capped)

    Example 2: Power Project
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Contract Value:                Rs. 50,00,00,000
    LD Rate:                       1.5% per week
    Maximum LD Cap:                15% = Rs. 7,50,00,000
    Actual Delay:                  8 weeks

    LD Calculation:
    - Weekly LD = 1.5% x Rs. 50,00,00,000 = Rs. 75,00,000
    - Total LD for 8 weeks = Rs. 75,00,000 x 8 = Rs. 6,00,00,000
    - Within maximum cap of Rs. 7,50,00,000
    - Therefore, LD Payable = Rs. 6,00,00,000

2.2 DELAY LD - MILESTONE-BASED

    For projects with critical interim milestones:

    Clause Template:
    "The Contractor shall pay Liquidated Damages for delay in achieving each
    Milestone as per the following schedule:

    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Milestone          │ Target Date │ LD Rate/Week │ Max LD Cap      │
    ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ Foundation Complete│ Month 3     │ 0.25%        │ 2.5%           │
    │ Structure Complete │ Month 8     │ 0.5%         │ 5%             │
    │ MEP Installation   │ Month 12    │ 0.75%        │ 7.5%           │
    │ Final Completion   │ Month 15    │ 1.0%         │ 10%            │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    Cumulative Milestone LD shall not exceed overall project LD cap."

2.3 SECTIONAL COMPLETION LD

    For projects with multiple sections/packages:

    "Delay Liquidated Damages shall be calculated separately for each Section
    as follows:

    Section A (Tower 1): LD @ 0.5% per week, Max 10% of Section A value
    Section B (Tower 2): LD @ 0.5% per week, Max 10% of Section B value
    Section C (Common Areas): LD @ 0.75% per week, Max 12% of Section C value

    Total LD for all sections shall not exceed 10% of Total Contract Value."

2.4 PARTIAL LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

    "If only a part of the Works is delayed beyond the Time for Completion,
    the Liquidated Damages shall be calculated on a pro-rata basis:

    LD = (LD Rate x Contract Value x % of Delayed Work x Delay Period)

    Example: If 30% of works delayed by 10 weeks:
    LD = 0.5% x Rs. 10 Cr x 30% x 10 weeks = Rs. 15,00,000"


SECTION 3: PERFORMANCE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
================================================================================

3.1 PERFORMANCE SHORTFALL LD

    A. OUTPUT/CAPACITY SHORTFALL (Power, Manufacturing, Process Plants):

    "If the Guaranteed Performance Parameters are not achieved during Performance
    Tests, the Contractor shall pay Performance Liquidated Damages as follows:

    Parameter: Power Output (Guaranteed: 100 MW)
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Actual Output Range    │ LD Rate           │ Maximum LD
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    95 MW to < 100 MW      │ 1% per MW shortfall│ 5% of Contract Value
    90 MW to < 95 MW       │ 1.5% per MW shortfall│ 7.5% of Contract Value
    85 MW to < 90 MW       │ 2% per MW shortfall│ 10% of Contract Value
    < 85 MW                │ Rejection/Termination Right

    Calculation Example:
    Actual Output: 92 MW (Shortfall: 8 MW)
    Contract Value: Rs. 200 Crores
    LD = 1.5% x 8 x Rs. 200 Cr = Rs. 24 Crores (within 7.5% cap = Rs. 15 Cr)
    Therefore, LD Payable = Rs. 15 Crores (capped)"

    B. EFFICIENCY SHORTFALL:

    "Guaranteed Efficiency: 95%
    Actual Efficiency: 92% (Shortfall: 3%)
    LD Rate: 2% of Contract Value per 1% efficiency shortfall
    LD = 2% x 3 x Contract Value

    If Contract Value = Rs. 50 Crores:
    LD = 2% x 3 x Rs. 50 Cr = Rs. 3 Crores"

3.2 QUALITY DEFECT LD

    "For defects identified during Defect Liability Period beyond acceptable
    limits:

    A. MINOR DEFECTS (Cosmetic, non-structural):
       - LD: Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 25,000 per defect
       - Or: Cost of rectification x 1.5 (whichever is higher)

    B. MAJOR DEFECTS (Affecting functionality):
       - LD: Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 5,00,000 per defect
       - Or: Cost of rectification x 2.0
       - Plus: Extension of Defect Liability Period

    C. CRITICAL DEFECTS (Structural/Safety):
       - LD: Up to 5% of affected work package value
       - Plus: Mandatory rectification at Contractor's cost
       - Plus: Extension of warranty period by 12 months"

3.3 EQUIPMENT AVAILABILITY LD (O&M Contracts)

    "Guaranteed Equipment Availability: 95% per month

    Availability Achieved │ LD Rate per % below target
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    90% to < 95%         │ 0.5% of Monthly O&M Fee
    85% to < 90%         │ 1.0% of Monthly O&M Fee
    80% to < 85%         │ 1.5% of Monthly O&M Fee
    < 80%                │ 2.0% + Termination right

    Example:
    Monthly O&M Fee: Rs. 10,00,000
    Guaranteed Availability: 95%
    Actual Availability: 88% (Shortfall: 7%)
    LD = 1.0% x 7 x Rs. 10,00,000 = Rs. 70,000"


SECTION 4: SAFETY, HEALTH & ENVIRONMENT (SHE) PENALTIES
================================================================================

4.1 SAFETY VIOLATION PENALTIES

    "The Contractor shall pay the following penalties for safety violations:

SECTION 12: SAMPLE PENALTY CALCULATION SCENARIOS
================================================================================

SCENARIO 1: Building Construction Delay
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Contract Value:           Rs. 50,00,00,000
Scheduled Completion:     24 months from start (730 days)
LD Rate:                  0.5% per week
Maximum LD:               10% = Rs. 5,00,00,000
Actual Completion:        28 months (850 days)
Delay:                    120 days = 17 weeks

Calculation:
Weekly LD = 0.5% x Rs. 50 Cr = Rs. 25,00,000
Total LD = Rs. 25,00,000 x 17 weeks = Rs. 4,25,00,000

EOT Granted:              30 days (Employer delay) = 4 weeks
Revised Delay:            17 - 4 = 13 weeks
Final LD Payable:         Rs. 25,00,000 x 13 = Rs. 3,25,00,000

Recovery:
From Final Payment:       Rs. 3,25,00,000 (deducted)


SCENARIO 2: Manufacturing Plant Performance Shortfall
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Contract Value:           Rs. 100,00,00,000
Guaranteed Output:        1000 Tonnes/day
LD Rate:                  1% per % shortfall
Maximum LD:               15% = Rs. 15,00,00,000
Actual Output:            920 Tonnes/day
Shortfall:                8%

Performance LD:
LD = 1% x 8% x Rs. 100 Cr = Rs. 8,00,00,000

Time Delay LD:            Rs. 5,00,00,000 (separate calculation)

Total Penalty:            Rs. 13,00,00,000 (within 15% cap)


SCENARIO 3: Multiple Penalties - Cumulative Cap Application
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Contract Value:           Rs. 25,00,00,000
Maximum LD Cap:           10% = Rs. 2,50,00,000

Individual Penalties:
- Time Delay LD:          Rs. 1,50,00,000
- Performance LD:         Rs. 80,00,000
- Safety Penalties:       Rs. 30,00,000

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. LEGAL VALIDITY:
   - All penalty clauses must comply with Section 74, Indian Contract Act
   - Courts may reduce penalties deemed excessive or unreasonable
   - Genuine pre-estimate of loss has better enforceability

2. CONTRACTUAL HIERARCHY:
   - Special Conditions of Contract (SCC) override GCC
   - Project-specific penalty rates may differ from these standard rates
   - Always refer to Contract Data/Appendix for actual applicable rates

3. MITIGATION FACTORS:
   - Contractor should maintain detailed records of delays and causes
   - Timely EOT claims can reduce/eliminate penalty exposure
   - Communication and documentation are critical for defense

4. PRACTICAL APPLICATION:
   - Penalties should be fair, reasonable, and commercially viable
   - Excessive penalties may make projects commercially unviable
   - Balance between deterrence and commercial fairness is essential

5. DISPUTE RESOLUTION:
   - Penalty disputes are common in construction litigation
   - Maintain audit trail of all penalty calculations and notices
   - Consider negotiated settlement before litigation
