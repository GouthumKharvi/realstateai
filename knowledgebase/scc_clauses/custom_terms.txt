SECTION 1: HIERARCHY AND PRIORITY OF DOCUMENTS
================================================================================

1.1 ORDER OF PRECEDENCE - DETAILED INTERPRETATION

    In the event of any ambiguity, discrepancy, or conflict between Contract
    Documents, the following order of precedence shall apply (highest to lowest):
    
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │Rank│ Document Type              │ Scope of Coverage  │ Typical Page Count│
    ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

    │    │ (in reverse chronological  │                    │                   │
    │    │  order - latest first)     │                    │                   │

    │ 10 │ Codes, Standards, and Laws │ Reference standards│ Varies            │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    
    Interpretation Principles:
    - Specific provisions prevail over general provisions
    - Handwritten amendments prevail over typed (if properly initialed)
    - Later-dated documents prevail over earlier for the same subject matter
    - Technical drawings prevail over specifications for dimensions
    - Specifications prevail over drawings for quality/materials

1.2 RESOLVING CONFLICTS - REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES

    Example 1: Payment Terms Conflict
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    GCC Clause 14.7    : Payment within 60 days
    SCC Clause 14.7    : Payment within 45 days (MSME vendor)
    LoA Special Condition: Payment within 30 days for this critical package
    
    RESOLUTION: LoA prevails → 30 days payment timeline applicable
    
    Example 2: LD Rate Conflict
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    GCC Clause 8.7     : LD @ 0.5% per week, max 10%
    SCC Clause 8.7     : LD @ 0.75% per week, max 10%
    BOQ Preamble       : LD @ 1.0% per week, max 12%
    
    RESOLUTION: SCC prevails over GCC → 0.75% per week, 10% cap
    (BOQ preamble does not override contractual clauses unless specifically
    stated in LoA)
    
    Example 3: Specification vs Drawing Conflict
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Specification      : Column size 450mm x 600mm
    Structural Drawing : Column size 500mm x 600mm
    
    RESOLUTION: Drawing prevails for dimensions → 500mm x 600mm
    (But Contractor must issue RFI to confirm before execution)

1.3 AMBIGUITY AND INTERPRETATION

    If any ambiguity, doubt, or dispute arises regarding interpretation:
    
    Step 1: Contractor raises Request for Information (RFI) in writing
    Step 2: Employer's Engineer issues Clarification within 14 days
    Step 3: If interpretation affects cost/time, treated as Variation
    Step 4: If unresolved, escalated as per Dispute Resolution clause
    
    Good Faith Principle:
    - Contract shall be interpreted to give business efficacy
    - Contra proferentem rule: Ambiguity interpreted against drafter (usually
      Employer, except for Contractor's design/method statements)


SECTION 2: COMMERCIAL CUSTOMIZATIONS - ADVANCED SCENARIOS
================================================================================

2.1 PRICE STRUCTURE AND ADJUSTMENT MECHANISMS

    A. CONTRACT PRICE BASIS:
       This Contract is: [SELECT ONE]
       ☐ Firm Price (no escalation except statutory tax changes)
       ☐ Partially Adjustable (materials only, labor firm)
       ☐ Fully Adjustable (materials + labor + equipment)
       ☐ Hybrid (different basis for different work packages)
    
    B. PRICE ESCALATION FORMULA (IF ADJUSTABLE):
       
       Formula-based escalation using Wholesale Price Index (WPI):
       
       P₁ = P₀ × [0.15 + 0.40(L₁/L₀) + 0.30(M₁/M₀) + 0.15(E₁/E₀)]
       
       Where:
       P₁ = Adjusted price for payment
       P₀ = Base contract price (as per LoA)
       L₁/L₀ = Labor cost index ratio
       M₁/M₀ = Material cost index ratio
       E₁/E₀ = Equipment/fuel cost index ratio
       
       Weightages: 15% fixed, 40% labor, 30% material, 15% equipment/fuel
       
       Detailed Example Calculation:
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Base Contract Price (P₀)           : Rs. 100,00,00,000
       Base Date (28 days before bid)     : June 1, 2025
       Payment Date                       : January 1, 2027 (Month 19)
       
       Index Values (Source: Ministry of Statistics):
       Base Date (June 2025):
       - Labor Index (L₀)    : 325.4
       - Material Index (M₀) : 412.6
       - Fuel Index (E₀)     : 368.2
       
       Payment Date (Jan 2027):
       - Labor Index (L₁)    : 342.8
       - Material Index (M₁) : 445.3
       - Fuel Index (E₁)     : 389.7
       
       Calculation:
       L₁/L₀ = 342.8/325.4 = 1.0535
       M₁/M₀ = 445.3/412.6 = 1.0793
       E₁/E₀ = 389.7/368.2 = 1.0584
       
       P₁ = 100,00,00,000 × [0.15 + 0.40×1.0535 + 0.30×1.0793 + 0.15×1.0584]
          = 100,00,00,000 × [0.15 + 0.4214 + 0.3238 + 0.1588]
          = 100,00,00,000 × 1.054
          = Rs. 105,40,00,000
       
       Escalation Amount = Rs. 5,40,00,000 (5.4% over 19 months)
       
       Conditions:
       - Escalation applicable only after 6 months from contract award
       - Maximum escalation cap: 10% of original contract value
       - Negative escalation (de-escalation) also applicable if indices fall
       - Paid monthly based on work done in that month
    
    C. FOREIGN CURRENCY COMPONENT (FOR INTERNATIONAL CONTRACTS):
       
       If Contract involves import of equipment/materials:
       
       - Foreign Currency (FC) component: ___% of Contract Price
       - Base Exchange Rate: Rs. _____ per USD/EUR (as on base date)
       - FC Price Adjustment:

         • Rate source: State Bank of India (SBI) TT Selling Rate
         • Maximum variation cap: ±15% of base rate
         • Beyond ±15%: Mutual negotiation or cost-sharing mechanism
       
       Example:

       Equipment import value : USD 2,000,000
       Base rate (June 2025)  : Rs. 83.00/USD
       INR equivalent         : Rs. 16.60 Crores
       
       At payment (Jan 2027)  : Rs. 87.50/USD
       Payable amount         : Rs. 17.50 Crores
