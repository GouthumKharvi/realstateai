    ────────────────────────────────────
    - Business/Project owner prepares Business Case / Concept Note
    - Includes: Scope, vendor, value, justification, strategic alignment
    - Risk assessment (high/medium/low)
    - Budget approval obtained (Finance)
    - Vendor pre-qualified (from Approved Vendor List)

    Step 2: CONTRACT DRAFTING
    ────────────────────────
    Choose One:
    Option A: Use Organization's Standard Template
    - Select appropriate template (works/goods/services/consultancy)
    - Customize as required
    - Legal review scope: Limited to deviations
    - Faster approval process

    Option B: Use Counterparty Template
    - Counterparty provides draft
    - Requires full Legal review

    ☑ Technical/Operations (5 days)
    ☑ Compliance/Risk (3 days if triggered)

    ──────────────────────────
    Approval workflow initiated:
    - Digital approval system (ERP / DMS) used
    - Routing based on value and risk
    - Approver receives summary, final draft, attachments
    - Review period: 3-7 days per level

    Approval Actions:
    ☐ APPROVE (unconditional)
    ☐ APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS (conditions specified)

    ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ < Rs. 50 lakhs      │ Department Head / Manager        │
    │ Rs. 50 L - 5 Cr     │ Business Unit Head / GM          │
    │ Rs. 5 - 50 Cr       │ Chief Operating Officer / CEO    │
    │ > Rs. 50 Cr / Board │ CEO / Board Member              │
    │ Strategic / Govt    │ CEO or Board authorised person  │

4.2 APPROVAL PROCESS FOR AMENDMENTS

    A. TYPES OF AMENDMENTS:

       │ Amendment Type    │ Approval Level │ Timeline           │
       ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
       │ Minor (non-monetary) │ Level 3 minimum │ 5 days        │
       │ e.g., contact change │ (no legal req) │                │
       ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
       │ Value increase    │ Next level above │ 10 days        │
       │ e.g., +15%        │ original approval │                │
       ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
       │ Scope change      │ Legal review +   │ 15 days        │
       │ e.g., extend term │ original level   │                │
       ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
       │ Material change   │ Escalate 2 levels│ 20 days        │
       │ e.g., risk shift  │ + Legal          │                │
       │ e.g., delay LD >5%│                  │                │
       └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    B. CUMULATIVE VALUE RULE:
       Original + All Amendments = Cumulative Total
       Approval based on cumulative total, not incremental.

       Example:
       Original approval (Rs. 50 Cr): CEO level
       Amendment +1 (Rs. 10 Cr): New total Rs. 60 Cr → Board approval required
       Amendment +2 (Rs. 5 Cr): New total Rs. 65 Cr → Board approval

    C. AMENDMENT PROCESS:
       Step 1: Prepare amendment brief (1-2 pages)
       Step 2: Cite original clause(s) being amended
       Step 3: Show before/after comparison
       Step 4: Justification and business rationale
       Step 5: Regulatory/legal implications (if any)
       Step 6: Attach support documents (quotes, RFIs, etc.)
       Step 7: Circulate with original contract for reference
       Step 8: Approval as per DoA for amended contract value
       Step 9: Execute addendum (counterparty signature required)


SECTION 5: STANDARD VS NON-STANDARD CONTRACTS
================================================================================

5.1 STANDARD CONTRACTS - ACCELERATED PROCESS

    A. ORGANIZATION'S APPROVED TEMPLATES:

    B. APPROVAL PROCESS (ACCELERATED):
       - Template used without modifications: 50% faster approval

       - Material modifications: Treated as non-standard

       Simplified Checklist:
       ☑ Clause deviations (if any) noted
       ☑ Pricing competitive (3 quotes preferred)
       ☑ Payment terms within policy
       ☑ Vendor approved
       ☑ Budget available

    C. DEVIATION MANAGEMENT:
       Deviation Analysis Template:

       ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
       │ Clause / Item         │ Counterparty Proposal │ Risk Level│
       ├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
       │ Liability Cap         │ Unlimited            │ RED       │
       │ Mitigation: Cap at 2x contract value                      │
       │                                                            │
       │ Payment Terms         │ 60 days              │ YELLOW    │
       │ Mitigation: Request 45 days (acceptable)                  │

       │ Governing Law         │ English law          │ RED       │
       │ Mitigation: Maintain Indian law + India jurisdiction      │
       └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    D. NEGOTIATION STRATEGY:
       - Prioritize (must-have vs nice-to-have deviations)
       - Escalate to vendor's senior management if needed
       - Document all negotiation rounds

SECTION 8: EXCEPTION HANDLING AND SPECIAL APPROVALS
================================================================================

8.1 EXPEDITED / EMERGENCY CONTRACTS

    A. CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING EMERGENCY APPROVAL:
       - Urgent business need (production stoppage, safety issue, legal deadline)
       - Supplier emergency (sole source failure, sudden availability)
       - Force majeure (natural disaster, pandemic, war impacts)
       - Regulatory requirement (compliance deadline)

    B. PROCESS:
       Step 1: Urgent approval request (in writing)
       Step 2: Business justification (why urgent, alternatives considered)
       Step 3: Compressed review (2-3 days instead of standard 10-15)
       Step 4: Verbal approval allowed (documented immediately)
       Step 5: Full documentation post-signature (within 7 days)

    C. LIMITATIONS:
       - Cannot waive legal review entirely (minimum checklist)
       - Cannot skip vendor pre-qualification entirely
       - Financial limits still apply (no escalation beyond normal)
       - Must complete formal approval within 30 days
       - Post-facto audit and review mandatory

8.2 SOLE SOURCE / SINGLE VENDOR EXCEPTIONS

    When ONLY ONE VENDOR available or qualified:

    Documentation Required:
    ☑ Written justification (why no competitive bidding possible)
    ☑ Market research / vendor search evidence
    ☑ Technical requirement forcing single source (if any)
    ☑ Price reasonableness certification (benchmarked if possible)
    ☑ Approval: One level higher than standard
    ☑ Recorded exception in Exception Register

    Examples of Justified Single Source:
    - Proprietary equipment / technology (only manufacturer)
    - Warranty/extension from original equipment supplier
    - Specialized service requiring specific certification
    - Government-mandated sole vendor
    - Follow-on work requiring continuity of design/execution

       - Assess: Risk management adequacy

       - High-value/risk contracts (>Rs. 10 Cr): Quarterly
       - Strategic contracts: Quarterly
       - Long-term contracts: Annual health check
       - Dispute/claim tracking: Monthly

    C. RED FLAGS (Trigger Special Audit):
       - Contract approved without proper reviews
       - Value significantly exceeds scope
       - Vendor not pre-qualified

NOTES:
1. This ultra-comprehensive contract approval policy is designed for RAG/AI
   systems to answer complex, multi-dimensional queries on contract governance.
2. All thresholds, approval levels, and timelines should be customized per
   organization size, risk appetite, and industry sector.
3. Regular policy review (annually) recommended to incorporate learnings and
   regulatory changes [ref: Indian Contract Act, 1872; Companies Act, 2013].
4. For specific industries (construction, power, IT), additional sector-specific
   policies may be required as supplements to this general policy.
